Learning React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is a significant step for any web developer looking to specialize in front-end development or full-stack development with a focus on modern web applications. React's component-based architecture offers a powerful and efficient approach to developing large-scale applications. Below is a structured curriculum to guide you through learning React from the basics to more advanced concepts.

### Prerequisites
Before diving into React, ensure you have a solid understanding of:
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+ syntax, functions, classes, asynchronous programming)
- Basic knowledge of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Week 1: Introduction to React

- **Day 2: React Basics**
  - Understanding JSX (JavaScript XML)
  - Rendering elements
  - Introduction to components and props

- **Day 3: Components Deep Dive**
  - Class vs Functional components
  - State and lifecycle methods in class components
  - Handling events

- **Day 4: Advanced Components**
  - Hooks in React (useState, useEffect)
  - Custom hooks
  - Conditional rendering

- **Day 5: Styling in React**
  - CSS in React
  - Styled-components
  - CSS Modules

### Week 2: State Management and Routing
